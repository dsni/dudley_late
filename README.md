## Dudley Late Checker

Many people in Boston use the mass transit system (MBTA) every day. But what happens when the MBTA runs late? For students in the Boston area, this can cause students to accumulate undeserved tardies and absences. This program works to create a system in which teachers can cross-check whether a student is late due to MBTA delays or not.
